### Do you like PyTorch? Do you like karpathy/micrograd? Do you like tinygrad?
Well, this is none of those. Hell I don't even know what this is.

It's a deep learning framework made from ground up for the sole purpose of me developing a detailed understanding every part of deep learning on a low level.

Starting from as low as efficient matrix multiplies in CUDA all the way to training LLMs (hopefully).
